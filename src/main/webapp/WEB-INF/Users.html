        <div>Happy Day is an application designed to filter out certain words and context based off of its overall happiness.
            This application's goal is to prevent cyber bullying across social media platforms. Social shaming and things of the such should not be tolerated in
            today's society. Individuals should be able to use social media application without the worry of being judged by their peers or any others.
            Our overall goal with Happy day is to maximize happiness similar to a utilitarian standpoint. Any words seen as 'unhappy' in our database
            will return a null value not allowing that content to be posted as a result.
