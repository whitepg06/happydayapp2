        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h1>
        <h2>What is HAPPY DAY?</h2>
        <img src='http://cdn.tinybuddha.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Happy-woman-smiling.jpg' height='350' width='350' align="left">
        <div>Welcome to HAPPY DAY, we are a social media website that prides on the blocking of negative energy. Our goal is to filter
        out specific words to lower cyber bullying through the internet to prevent social shaming. In today's society social shaming can
        lead to things such as suicide or self-harm. Social media websites such as twitter, facebook, and instagram promote
        such cyber bullying and social shaming. Sometimes leading to depression or other serious acts against oneself. Social shaming is something
        that exists in today's society that can be prevented by bring only happiness, hence our application HAPPY DAY.
        Happy Day is an application designed to filter out certain words and context based off of its overall happiness.
        This application's goal is to prevent cyber bullying across social media platforms. Social shaming and things of the such should not be tolerated in
        today's society. Individuals should be able to use social media application without the worry of being judged by their peers or any others.
        Our overall goal with Happy day is to maximize happiness similar to a utilitarian standpoint. Any words seen as 'unhappy' in our database
        will return a null value not allowing that content to be posted as a result.
        </div>
        
        <h2>What do we wish to achieve?</h2>
        <div>With the HAPPY DAY application we are trying to achieve a space where people can genuinely be happy without the concern
        of their personal image. Through this application we aim to lower the users such as trolls, cyber-bullies, and etc. Today 
        we tend to ignore how what we say may affect someone else even on a self-conscious level. Overall, through this application
        we seek to gain overall happiness amongst our users to prevent the need for likes, comments, and shares. But, focus on the happiness
        of the users opposed to the yearning of social gratification .</div>
        
        
        <h2>What gave us the HAPPY DAY idea?</h2>
        <div>We received the idea for HAPPY DAY after discovering how people have committed suicide from platforms of social media through
        social shaming. Examples of this occur on shows such as <i>13 Reasons Why</i> display how a student could commit suicide from social shaming
        the image society has of us generally makes us care of that opinion at all times. Not allowing people to be happy as a result. But, instead hide
        behind filters, likes, and the comments of friends. Depending on the abundance of these likes and comments this grants something satisfaction
        or as we like to call it happiness. As we found happiness is generally controlled on social platforms as a popularity contest we saw it would
        be more beneficial to base a system off of general happiness of the photo to eliminate the prospect of receiving likes or comments. Instead,
        viewers would be rating the happiness of the photo.</div>
        
        <h2>Why a social media platform?</h2>
        <div>We chose a social media platform because it is currently the most used applications up to date as of currently. Instagram, Facebook,
        and Twitter are the most used social media applications used. On those applications users have been socially shamed by their peers through a wrongfully
        shared video or maybe even a post that that person genuinely enjoyed that was negatively commented on. It is not something rare to see a promotion
        of happiness through these applications, but rather negative images are endorsed more so. Such as fighting videos that have been posted of someone being
        rendered unconscious and posted all over Facebook to be shared a multitude of times. Causing that person to be shamed across the world by several individuals that
        may never even meet this person. Not to mention the people said person may know in person which crafts an image of this person that sometimes is not be true.</div>
        
        <h1>HAPPY DAY Policies</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Rules of Engagement</h2>
    <p>The Institution would like to encourage our employees, members at all levels, and the wider public to engage in our online media facilities. The Institution recognizes that the use of online 
    media such as discussion forums and social networking sites can be informative in relation to professional areas and developing working relationships. We have therefore set out some simple rules 
    of engagement to help you.</p>

    <h2>Openness and Transparency of HAPPY DAY</h2>
    <p>It is important to be open and transparent in order to build up trust with our audience. When you use online media you should clearly identify yourself using your real name and, if relevant, state your 
    association with the Institution. If you are producing content on behalf of the Institution you must not remain anonymous. You should always check facts before publishing content online and not mislead your 
    audience in anyway.<p/>

    <h2>First person</h2>
    <p>Speak in first person and be yourself. Using an approachable tone and conveying your own personality can really help to encourage 
        interaction between you and the audience.</p>

    <h2>Judgment</h2>
    <p>Remember that there are consequences to what you publish. There may be times where you feel something has been misrepresented.
    If you need to correct the content of another user please do so with respect and keep to the facts. If you feel even remotely 
    uncomfortable with something you are about to publish try to identify why or seek advice.</p>

    <h2>Public Domain</h2>
    <p>Be mindful of the fact that any content that you publish will be in the public domain and in some cases will remain public for a 
    long time. You are personally responsible for any content that you publish. Be aware that your content may provoke a response and 
    be open to the opinions of others.</p>

    <h2>Corrections</h2>
    <p>If you publish content which you later recognise as inaccurate or someone informs you that it is inaccurate, be honest about your 
    mistake and correct it as soon as possible. Always include a correction statement to prevent the audience from thinking you have 
    attempted to ‘cover up’ a mistake.</p>

    <h2>Representing the Institution</h2>
    <p>Use a disclaimer which explains that content is your personal opinion and does not represent the views of Institution. 
    For example: ‘the postings on this site are my own and do not necessarily represent the Institution’s position’. Do not use 
    Institution logos or trademarks without approval. You are welcome to contact the Institution to review information you would like 
    to publish or ask to use our branding if you think it would benefit your content.</p>

    <h2>Protect confidentiality</h2>
    <p>Protect yourself and the confidentiality of others and the Institution. While you should be identifiable you must protect your 
    privacy and personal details. You should have consideration for the privacy of others and not disclose personal information about 
    another user. Never discuss Institution business performance – this includes: discussing future business plans, unannounced 
    strategies and financial analysis. If you are unsure of a particular subject you should review what you are about to publish or 
    seek advice.</p>

    <h2>Protect clients, partners and suppliers</h2>
    <p>You must not cite or reference your clients, partners or suppliers without their approval. If you have permission to discuss matters
    relating to a client, partner or supplier you must not reveal confidential information. It is acceptable to discuss general details 
    of a project if you protect anonymity and ensure you do not violate any non-disclosure agreements. You can disguise a partner’s 
    identity for example by saying ‘Partner 001’.</p>

    <h2>Respect</h2>
    <p>Do not use ethnic slurs, personal insults, obscenity, or engage in any conduct that would not be acceptable in the work place. 
        Avoid inflammatory subject areas – such as politics and religion.</p>

    <h2>Add Value</h2>
    <p>Provide informative content and interesting perspectives. The Institution and structural engineering industry is best 
        represented by its people. When you decide to contribute to an online media resource you are deciding to be an ambassador for 
        the Institution and even the wider structural engineering community. When you are producing content always consider how your 
        information will improve knowledge, build on ideas and help to problem solve.</p>

    <h2>Moderation</h2>
    <p>The Institution has a responsibility to monitor and review all content that is associated with the organisation or posted on 
        its behalf. If the Institution identifies content which is not in line with these guidelines it has a right to either a.) delete 
        content where it has administration rights on the specific site or b.) demand the removal of content. Where content is deleted a 
        correction notice will be published.</p>

    <i>If you as user identify potentially damaging or content that is in breach of the guidelines please contact the Administers of HAPPY DAY.</i>

    <p>The Institution cannot provide legal advice in relation to using online media. However there are a number of legal areas to keep in mind
        when using online media on behalf of the Institution:</p>
