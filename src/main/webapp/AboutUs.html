        <div>Welcome to HAPPY DAY, we are a social media website that prides on the blocking of negative energy. Our goal is to filter
        out specific words to lower cyber bullying through the internet to prevent social shaming. In today's society social shaming can
        lead to things such as suicide or self-harm. Social media websites such as twitter, facebook, and instagram promote
        such cyber bullying and shaming. Sometimes leading to depression or other serious acts against oneself. Social shaming is something
        that exists in today's society that can be prevented by bring only happiness, hence our application HAPPY DAY.
        Happy Day is an application designed to filter out certain words and context based off of its overall happiness.
        This application's goal is to prevent cyber bullying across social media platforms. Social shaming and things of the such should not be tolerated in
        today's society. Individuals should be able to use social media application without the worry of being judged by their peers or any others.
        Our overall goal with Happy day is to maximize happiness similar to a utilitarian standpoint. Any words seen as 'unhappy' in our database
        will return a null value not allowing that content to be posted as a result.

        <h2>What do we wish to achieve?</h2>
        <div>With the HAPPY DAY application we are trying to achieve a space where people can genuinely be happy without the concern
        of their personal image. Through this application we aim to lower the users such as trolls, cyber-bullies, and etc. Today 
        we tend to ignore how what we say may affect someone else even on a self-conscious level. Overall, through this application
        we seek to gain overall happiness amongst our users to prevent the need for likes, comments, and shares. But, focus on the happiness
        of the users opposed to the social gratification.</div>

        <h2>What gave us the HAPPY DAY idea?</h2>
        <div>We received the idea for HAPPY DAY after discovering how people have committed suicide from platforms of social media through
            social shaming. Examples of this occur on shows such as <i>13 Reasons Why</i> display how a student could commit suicide from social shaming
            the image society has of us generally makes us care of that opinion at all times. Not allowing people to be happy as a result. But, instead hide
        behind filters, likes, and the comments of friends. Depending on the abundance of these likes and comments this grants something satisfaction
        or as we like to call it happiness. As we found happiness is generally controlled on social platforms as a popularity contest we saw it would
        be more beneficial to base a system off of general happiness of the photo to eliminate the prospect of receiving likes or comments. Instead,
        viewers would be rating the happiness of the photo.</div>
        
        <h2>Why a social media platform?</h2>
        <div>We chose a social media platform because it is currently the most used applications up to date as of currently. Instagram, Facebook,
        and Twitter are the most used social media applications used. On those applications users have been socially shamed by their peers through a wrongfully
        shared video or maybe even a post that that person genuinely enjoyed that was negatively commented on. It is not something rare to see a promotion
        of happiness through these applications, but rather negative images are endorsed more so. Such as fighting videos that have been posted of someone being
        rendered unconscious and posted all over Facebook to be shared a multitude of times. Causing that person to be shamed across the world by several individuals that
        may never even meet this person. Not to mention the people said person may know in person which crafts an image of this person that sometimes is not be true.</div>
